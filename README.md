#Rock Paper Scissors Minigame

[Live Preview](https://jod-nhk.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/rps.html)

Hello! This project was a part of an exercise by The Odin Project.

The first version was played purely in the console involving the user to type r, p or s. After which
the computer will randomly generate another rps and the console will diaplay the result

The second version integrated HTML, practising the use of new things like addEventListener, querySelector,
textContent. 

Reflection:
1. Still not used to CSS styling concepts such as centering, when to use different displays, the position attribute etc.
   though I'm starting to get used to flexbox. Since there are a lot of ways you can center things it can get daunting to
   know which to use.

2. For JS, my main (unsolved) issues are 
    1. how to add parameters to function in addEventListener
    2. whether var is the only way to change a global variable from within a function.
